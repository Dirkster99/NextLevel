<h1>Features</h1>
<p>This list describes main features as of Version 2.00, Build 30.</p>
<ul>
<li>
  Every procedure or trigger (short: <b>PROC</b>) is listed with a:
  <ul>
    <li>a list of <a href="callgraph.html"><u>calling procedures</u></a>,</li>
    <li>a <a href="callgraph.html"><u>maximum callgraph</u></a>,</li>
    <li>and a <a href="callgraph.html"><u>list of accessed tables or views</u></a>.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
Names of tables and procedures are <a href="highlight.html"><u>highlighted</u></a>
and linked within the HTML source code. Click on the name of a table or procedure
and you should be transported to a page summarizing the technical details of that
database object.
</li>
<li>
An <SPAN CLASS="kwd">INSERT</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="kwd">DELETE</SPAN>,
or <SPAN CLASS="kwd">UPDATE</SPAN> statement on a table can cause a
<a href="highlight.html#trigevent"><u>trigger to be invoked</u></a>,
if the targeted table has a trigger installed. This can be seen as an indirect
extension of a callgraph, because a procedure called <CODE>STORE_ITEM</CODE> could insert
a record in a table called <CODE>LINE_ITEM</CODE>. <CODE>LINE_ITEM</CODE> in turn may have an
<CODE>INSERT</CODE> trigger installed, which will be invoked before the procedure
<CODE>STORE_ITEM</CODE> is continued.
</li>
<li><p>
There is a summary page for each <a href="tblesum.html"><u>table</u></a>.
This summary page contains a list of procs that implement a
<CODE>SELECT</CODE>, <CODE>INSERT</CODE>, <CODE>DELETE</CODE>, or <CODE>UPDATE</CODE>
statement on a given table. Click on the statement and you should be transported
to the first occurrence in the target procedure, -click on the procedure name and
you should be transported to the PROC... well, you get the idea, don't you!?
</p></li>

<li><p>
Installed triggers for every table are shown on the index HTML page and the table
summary page. Click on the table name to get to the summary page of each trigger.
</p></li>

<li><p>
The parser is able to recognize <CODE>INSERTED</CODE> and <CODE>DELETED</CODE>
tables in triggers. Access statements are counted as accessing the base table.
If we have for example a trigger T_SALES_TRIG_U on a
<span class="tbl">SALES</span> table and the trigger implements an SQL statement
like <CODE><span class="kwd">SELECT</span> * <span class="kwd">FROM</span> inserted</CODE>,
then this is correctly recognized as a select statement on the <span class="tbl">SALES</span> tables.
</p></li>

<li>
<a name="Unrefed">Each</a> page generated by Nextlevel has a menu in the right upper corner. In
this menu there is an entry called &quot;Unreferenced&quot;
<IMG border="0" src ="../cogweel_16.jpg">.
This entry leads to a summary page that is similar to the main index page,
however, all procedures, triggers, tables, and views listed on the &quot;Unreferenced&quot;
page are listed, because there is no evidence for their usage within the database.
No evidence of usage means that Nextlevel did not encounter one SQL statement that makes
use of this object. The database object could therefore, be obsolete, or be used via dynamic SQL,
or be used by an external source (e.g. a client program or from an external database or server).
</li>

<li>
In the menu on the right upper corner of each page, there is an entry called
&quot;<a href="conns.html"><u>Connections</u></a>&quot;
<IMG border="0" src ="../radar.png">, which leads to a summary page for database objects
that access objects outside the current database.
</li>

<li><p>
In SQL, it is possible to declare a <CODE>cursor</CODE> in one part of the SQL
code and use that cursor (a few 100 lines) later in the same proc. Nextlevel
links the declaration statement with all other statements referring to that
<CODE>cursor</CODE>. It is thus, very easy to jump from the declaration to
the usage of a <CODE>cursor</CODE> (or back) without having to read all
intermediate lines.
</p></li>

<li><p>
NextLevel integrates with the HTML Help Workshop, which can be downloaded for free
from Microsoft's homepage (I hope to integrate other help systems soon).
The Windows Help System has the advantage that all output files are kept in
one physical file, using a minimum of space through compression, but,
at the same time, being very accessible through full text search features.
</p></li>

<li>
<p>
Resolving SQL database views is supported through a list of all recognized
definitions on the right side of the <a href="../../index.html"><u>database index page</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The definition page for a view looks very similar to that of  an SQL
<a href="tblesum.html"><u>table</u></a>,
except that views are shown with their SQL source code, which is
displayed and highlighted in the definition page. The view definition page shows
seperate tables for database objects that access the view
(procedures, views, or triggers) and database objects that are accessed
by the view (tables or views). Also, each column and their datatype is
shown to make accessing particular columns and their names easy as a pie ;)
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<P><b>Known issues with NextLevel</b>:</P>
<ul>
<li>Parsing SQL 92 style joins (<span class="kwd">LEFT OUTER</span>, <span class="kwd">INNER</span> etc.)
is now supported,
however a SQL 92 FROM clause may not be parsed correctly, if there are sub-selects within the FROM clause.

  <ul>
    <li><b>Symptoms</b>: Some table dependencies following a sub-select in an SQL-92 FROM clause may not
                  be recognized by the parser. You may notice missing SELECT dependencies, as a result.
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>
