This folder contains files for additional include documentation
on views or tables. Simply create an html files named after a
table/view and the owner of that database object:

<owner>_<database_object_name>.html

In this file you need only to create a simple paragraph, for example
with:

<p>

This table has a certain meaning.

</p>

Then rebuild the nextlevel pages, and the additional comment should show up
in the summary page for the database object.
