Working on a datawarehouse project at a large company has intrigued <a href="about.html"><u>me</u></a>
about reverse engineering Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) to the point that I had to sit
down, invent, and develop the NextLevel tool. The aim of this tool is to compute dependencies between
tables, views, procedures, and triggers in a database. This information may seem trivial to get at,
however, things get complicated given a few hundred triggers, procedures, views, and of course tables.

Note the menu in the upper right corner of this and <a href="../../index.html"><u>other pages</u></a>.
You will see this only, if you your browser is Javascript enabled.
Please enable Javascript on your browser, if you do not see the menu on the right upper corner, because your
experience with these pages will be much better. For starters, play around with the menu and make sure you
clicked on each entry at least once.
</P>
<P>
Begin your analysis by looking at the <a href="../../index.html"><u>index page</u></a> of the database catalog,
here you will find a list of tables, procedures, and views sorted by owner and object name. Note that database
objects owned by the database owner are stated with their name only, while objects owned by another user than the
owner of the database, are stated in the &quot;&lt;owner&gt;.&lt;object name&gt;&quot; syntax.
</P>
<P>
Just click on any of the names listed in the main table of the index page
(in the &quot;<a href="tblesum.html"><u>Table</u></a>&quot;,
&quot;<a href="callgraph.html"><u>Procedure</u></a>&quot;, or &quot;View&quot; column),
you should then see another page summarizing each database object with a
particular set of information.
</P>
<P>
In a standard RDBMS system it is possible to run a special stored procedure each time a record is inserted,
deleted, or updated on a table, this sort of stored procedure is known as a trigger. Triggers are shown next
to the name of a table, if a given table has a trigger installed.
The letters <SPAN CLASS="pnm">D</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="pnm">I</SPAN>, or <SPAN CLASS="pnm">U</SPAN>
represent a delete, insert, or update trigger, respectively. Just click on such a letter and you should be
transported to a page viewing summary information on that trigger.

NextLevel implements its functionality by parsing SQL source code. It is command line driven,
and outputs HTML files, as a result of its computations. The program is thus, suitable for a great
number of databases and operating systems. Currently, there are executable versions for Linux and Windows
in existence.
